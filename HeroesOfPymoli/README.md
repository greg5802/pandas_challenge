This is my submission for the "Pandas Challenge". I chose the Heroes of Pymoli case.


The two things I noticed about the case study included the following:
  1. Men tend to be the predominant gender doing most of the gaming. This could come to some as an obvious observation but in viewing the data, you see that men far outnumber women in the gaming realm.
  2. Most gaming occurs between the ages of 15 and 29. The "20-24" range was well-beyond the other age groups in terms of sheer numbers. That also makes sense given that is the time a lot of people are in institutions of higher learning and have more free time and fluidity in their personal schedules.
